## [0.3.0] - 2023-08-05

* renamed library from `ecto_named_fragment` to `ecto_fragment_extras` because it contains a little more than just the named_fragment() macro now ðŸ‘‡
* added inline fragments which allow inlining fragment params into the query string:
   
  ```elixir
  inline_fragment("coalesce(#{users.name}, #{^default_name})")
  ```
* added `frag/1` and `frag/2` as a shorthand for inline and named fragments depending on the arity it is called with.

## [0.2.0] - 2023-07-24

### Changed

* the `EctoNamedFragment` module needs to be imported now (no more `use`)
* changed interpolation syntax to use string interpolation (#{}). Please change your query strings from `named_fragment("foo(:a, :b)", a:1, b:2)` to `named_fragment("foo(#{:a}, #{:b})", a:1, b:2)`
  * this allows better syntax highlighting of param names within the query
  * it also drastically simplifies implementation of this library and improves compile times of this library as well as of the named_fragment macro


## [0.1.0] - 2023-07-17

### Added

* initial release
